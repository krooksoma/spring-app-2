----------@Component______
    - It is the root annotation
    Indicates that the class should be loaded into the BeanFactory
    and configured using annotations and inspections of the class itself

    Component scanning scans a base package and loads configuration automatically for each
    bean it finds. It uses other annotation to direct the IoC container and build the dependency graph

    DI is achieved with component scanning with the annotation @Autowired

    This instructs the IoC container to inject the bean into the needed value at that point

    Can be used on class attribute you should only set it on methods(aids on testing)
    if dependency is required it should be inserted into the constructor, if it isn't it should be on the setter


    @Qualifier
    Used when multiple implementations of an interface are needed to inject a specific version by name(caution! difficult manage application)

    @Value
    if you have properties or instances that need to be injected. It instructs the IoC container to put a value into a variable for use elsewhere

    To Start component scanning on your own you need java or xml configuration.
    If using springboot you gonna auto configuration through this method by special annotation @SpringBootApplication
    Base package defined within this configuration.
