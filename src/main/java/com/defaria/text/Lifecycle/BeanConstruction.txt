----Construction------

    Beans instantiated in the factory using constructors
    Done in the correct order to make suer all dependencies are always created first
    (Classes with the most dependencies will be instantiated at the end)
    Handle to the class instance remains in the bean factory for the lifecycle of the application
    for singletons, only.

    Eager vs Lazy

    by default all beans are instantiated eagerly

    to be a truly lazy bean there can be nothing depending on them.
    Lazy beans can be specified as lazy, but the ApplicationContext reserve the right to ignore

 >>>>>>>>>>>Phase Complete<<<<<<<<<<<<<

     Bean pointer still referenced in factory
     objects have been constructed and not available to use yet

    Post-Initialization DI

    should only be done on optional beans or dynamic beans. Anything that is required for your class to operate
    should be injected via constructor.

    After instantiation Setter are called - OOP (Construct before being able to use any methods in it)

    @Autowiring occurs here on all methods that are not constructors that have the autowiring annotation

    Java config behaves differently

>>>>>>>>>>>>Phase Completed<<<<<<<<

    - Beans Fully initialized
    - All initial dependencies injected
    - Beans still not ready for use
