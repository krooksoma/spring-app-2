--------Initialization phase-----------

    Most complex and interesting. Shortest phase.
    Where there is the most impact of the behavior of the application

    -> Begins when the ApplicationContext itself is created. Can be dona manually of via Runtime.

    It is further broken down into two phases.
        > Setup of the bean factory via its initialization.
        > Bean initialization itself and instantiation phase where your bean objects
        are truly created and then managed by the framework.


                          [Load Bean Definitions]
         {Bean definitions loaded > post process bean definitions} -> FOR EACH BEAN \|/

                Instantiate bean > Setter called > Bean post-processor(pre-init) > Initializer > Bean post-processor(post-init) ----> Ready for use


-------------Use Phase----------------

    Phase with the longest period but most interaction with Spring IoC is behind the scenes.

    You may be using abstractions from Spring but during the use phase most of the work with the framework is through
    proxies applied during the previous or initialization phase.

--------Destruction Phase----------

    Occurs when the application context starts to close by the calling of close method on it.
